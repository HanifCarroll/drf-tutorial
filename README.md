Tutorial for Django Rest Framework 3.14

This repository is the result of my using the Django Rest Framework for the first time.

## Some Thoughts
The [tutorial](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/tutorial/1-serialization/) was extremely well-written. It does a great job of taking you step by step through varying levels of abstraction. Had the tutorial only given me the end state (e.g. "Here, use these features and this is what you get."), it would have been much more difficult to understand what was really being done for me. Armed with that knowledge, I'm better able to choose which tool might be better to use in a given situation.

It's great that they have so many convenience tools for API development. That really impressed me, and I can see why so many people prefer Django for web app development. It seems like one could create an application incredibly quickly after a bit of practice. Since my goal is to help people and companies create MVPs, that's a huge plus. 

The one thing I'm concerned about is the lacking type system. I've become really fond of using statically typed languages through my work with TypeScript, and it makes me a bit anxious to consider to a dynamically typed language with type hints added on as a bit of an after-thought. I've seen plenty of posts online talking about the difficulties of refactoring or making changes with a large python codebase, but then what other language out there is statically typed and offers an insanely productive web application framework? Maybe the fact that I want to work on MVPs obviates any need to think about this problem, as the product can be rewritten in a different language afterwards.

The python and Django code felt pretty simple to read. There weren't any lines that I can think of that really left me scratching my head. I can always appreciate a nice, well thought out API.

The error messages that I received from Django during development were helpful and well-formatted. 

## Conclusion
I enjoyed going through the tutorial project. Django Rest Framework seems to be a great way to quickly develop an API while minimizing boilerplate code.
